when the player uses a door, the following must happen (eventually)

1) the destination level must be loaded and fast-forwarded

2) the player object and its party must be transferred into the destination level

3) objects that seek the player and may transit must be placed in transit

4) the source level must be saved

all transit-enabled objects have a home, and should transit home if their
goal proves unattainable, teleporting if the player hasn't seen them for some time
